# Game of Life :: MicroBit v2

### Information
Built in Rust, this project flashes Conway’s Game of Life onto a micro:bit v2, driving the LED matrix directly through the HAL. It wrangles some low-level hardware setup and timing overhead, but the payoff is a clean, embedded take on a classic cellular automaton—running bare-metal.
